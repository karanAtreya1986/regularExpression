Difference between + and multiply-
+ says – once or more times.
Multiply says zero or more times.

Regular expression has three classes-
1.	Character class
2.	Meta-character class
3.	Quantifier class

Pattern and matcher apis – will be present in all regex code.
Pattern is class.
Matcher Is class.
Pattern is basically the regex which we need.
Matcher – will pass the input string to match with the pattern.

Only two apis needed – pattern for defining pattern. 
Matcher – for matching against the pattern.

Pattern p = Pattern.compile("\\bA\\b");
this means check if capital "A" is present in string once only.
returns true or false accordingly.
\\b will include all spaces and backspaces.
so this pattern says search for "A" or <space>A<space> or A<space> or <space>A.
To find all the occurrences use find() method.
